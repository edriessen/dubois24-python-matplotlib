#  #DuBoisChallenge2024 using Python and Matplotlib

This repository contains a colletion of notebooks. The notebooks show you how to recreate some of W.E.B. Du Bois's Data Portraits using Matplotlib. 

To get started, copy the `2024` folder from the [DVS Du Bois Data Challenge repo](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge) and add it to the root of this project.

I'm also keep track of my progress on [my personal blog](https://www.edriessen.com/2024/02/07/developing-du-boiss-data-portraits-with-python-and-matplotlib/).
